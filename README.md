# 🌱 SmartCrops

SmartCrops is a web-based, AI-powered agricultural support platform designed to help smallholder farmers make better farming decisions. By combining crop image analysis with real-time weather data, SmartCrops provides instant crop health diagnoses and weather-based irrigation advice, enabling farmers to reduce crop losses, improve yields, and adapt to climate change.

The platform allows farmers to upload a photo of a crop leaf, receive clear insights into potential diseases or stress conditions, and view actionable recommendations in simple language. SmartCrops is built with accessibility in mind and is optimized for mobile devices commonly used by farmers.
